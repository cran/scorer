Title: Quickly Score Models
Version: 0.1.0
Description: A set of tools to quickly score models commonly used to data
    analysis and data science using uncommon scoring metrics. For example,
    you might want to use a weighted absolute percent error instead of
    a root mean square deviation to score that regression model.
